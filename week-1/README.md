# SheCodes

## Week 1 - Setting up your Environment
This week we will be helping you as you:
* Install Linux/Ubuntu on your laptop
  * If you have Windows, you can dual boot if you wish
  * If you have MacOS, you don't need to install Ubuntu, but should install `brew`
  * We do not recommend using virtual machines
* Install a text editor (Atom)
* Install a web browser (Chrome)
* Become familiar with the command line
* (Bonus) Install `nvm`

You will also be introduced to Javascript through some simple exercises.

### Command Line
You can find a beginners introduction to using the command line [here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html). Complete as many of the exercises as you can.

### JavaScript
There are several online resources to help you learn the basics of JavaScript.

* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

If you've never written an JavaScript, start with `Code Academy` until you are comfortable with the basics.  
If you've written a little JavaScript, start with the `Basic JavaScript` track on `FreeCodeCamp`.  
If you've completed a couple of JavaScript exercises already, start with `Codewars`.
